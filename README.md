Momentum AI is an intelligent agent designed to transform chaotic meeting audio into structured, editable, and actionable minutes instantly. This tool acts as a co-pilot for modern teams, doing the heavy lifting of note-taking and summarization while giving the user complete editorial control before finalizing the record.

This project is a submission for the **GenAI Agentic Bot Hackathon: Meeting Productivity Unleashed**.

## üåü Key Features

Momentum AI is packed with advanced, agentic features designed to turn every meeting into a productivity win:

* **üéôÔ∏è Audio-to-Minutes Pipeline:** Upload any common audio or video file (MP3, WAV, MP4, M4A) and let the agent handle the rest.
* **üß† Comprehensive AI Analysis:** Goes far beyond simple summaries to generate a rich, structured output, including:
    * **Sentiment Analysis:** Understand the tone and mood of the meeting at a glance.
    * **Topic Tagging:** Automatically generated keywords for easy reference and categorization.
    * **Detailed Discussion Points:** Captures the key topics and a detailed, multi-sentence summary of what was discussed.
    * **Thorough Action Item Extraction:** Intelligently identifies both explicit and *implied* tasks, assigning owners and deadlines.
* **‚úçÔ∏è Full Editorial Control (User-in-the-Loop):** The user has the final say on the meeting's record.
    * **Delete irrelevant points** or tasks with a single click.
    * **Manually add** new discussion points or action items that the AI may have missed, ensuring 100% accuracy.
* **ü§ñ Interactive RAG Chat:** "Chat with your transcript." Ask specific questions about the meeting ("What was the deadline for the pipeline fix?") and get instant, context-aware answers from the AI.
* **üì§ One-Click Notion Export:** After editing and finalizing the minutes, export the complete, beautifully formatted record to a Notion database with a single click.
* **‚ú® Polished & Responsive UI:** A clean, professional, and intuitive user interface designed for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Upload:** The user uploads an audio/video file of their meeting.
2.  **Process:** The backend transcribes the audio, and an LLM generates a detailed draft of the minutes, including sentiment, topics, discussion points, and action items.
3.  **Review & Edit:** The user reviews the AI-generated draft on a clean UI. They can delete any item or manually add new ones to ensure perfect accuracy.
4.  **Query (Optional):** The user can ask specific questions about the meeting via the RAG chat interface to gain deeper insights.
5.  **Export:** With one click, the final, curated minutes are sent to a Notion database.
